<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>1. Broken Access Control</h1><br/><p>• Access Control:</p><p>   ◇ enforces policy such that users cannoy act outside of their intended permissions.</p><p>   ◇ Failure leads </p><p>      ▪ to unauthorized disclosure</p><p>      ▪ modification, </p><p>      ▪ destruction of data, </p><p>      ▪ performing a business function outside the user&#39;s limit</p><p></p><p>• Common vulnerabilities include:</p><p>   ◇ Violation of the principle of least privilege or deny by default, where access should only be granted for particular capabilities, roles, or users, but is available to anyone.</p><p>   ◇ Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL (parameter tampering or force browsing), internal application state, or the HTML page, or by using an attack tool modifying API requests.</p><p>   ◇ Permitting viewing or editing someone else&#39;s account, by providing its unique identifier (insecure direct object references)</p><p>   ◇ Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE.</p><p>   ◇ Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in or acting as an admin when logged in as a user.</p><p>   ◇ Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token (JWT) access control token, or a cookie or hidden field manipulated to elevate privileges or abusing JWT invalidation.</p><p>   ◇ CORS misconfiguration allows API access from unauthorized/untrusted origins.</p><p>   ◇ Force browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated user or to privileged pages as a standard user.</p><p></p><p>• How to prevent:</p><p>   ◇ Except for public resources, deny by default.</p><p>   ◇ Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them throughout the application, including minimizing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) usage.</p><p>   ◇ Model access controls should enforce record ownership rather than accepting that the user can create, read, update, or delete any record.</p><p>   ◇ Unique application business limit requirements should be enforced by domain models.</p><p>   ◇ Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata (e.g., .git) and backup files are not present within web roots.</p><p>   ◇ Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate (e.g., repeated failures).</p><p>   ◇ Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from automated attack tooling.</p><p>   ◇ Stateful session identifiers should be invalidated on the server after logout. Stateless JWT tokens should rather be short-lived so that the window of opportunity for an attacker is minimized. For longer lived JWTs it&#39;s highly recommended to follow the OAuth standards to revoke access.</p><p></p><p>• Example Attack Scenarios</p><p>   ◇ </p><p></p><p></p></div>
