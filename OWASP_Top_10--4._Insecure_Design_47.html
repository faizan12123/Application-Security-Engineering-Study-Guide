<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>4. Insecure Design</h1><br/><p>• Insecure Design:</p><p>   ◇ Insecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses, expressed as “missing or ineffective control design.”</p><p>   ◇ There is a difference between insecure design and insecure implementation</p><p>   ◇ A secure design can still have implementation defects leading to vulnerabilities that may be exploited</p><p>   ◇ An insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against specific attacks</p><p></p><p>• Requirements and Resource Management</p><p>   ◇ Collect and negotiate the business requirements for an application with the business, including the protection requirements concerning confidentiality, integrity, availability, and authenticity of all data assets and the expected business logic</p><p>   ◇ Take into account how exposed your application will be and if you need segregation of tenants (additionally to access control)</p><p>   ◇ Compile the technical requirements, including functional and non-functional security requirements</p><p>   ◇ Plan and negotiate the budget covering all design, build, testing, and operation, including security activities</p><p></p><p>• Common Vulnerabilities:</p><p>   ◇ Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information</p><p>   ◇ Unprotected Storage of Credentials</p><p>   ◇ Trust Boundary Violation</p><p>   ◇ Insufficiently Protected Credentials</p><p></p><p>• Mitigation</p><p>   ◇ Establish and use a secure development lifecycle with AppSec professionals to help evaluate and design security and privacy-related controls</p><p>   ◇ Establish and use a library of secure design patterns or paved road ready to use components</p><p>   ◇ Use threat modeling for critical authentication, access control, business logic, and key flows</p><p>   ◇ Integrate security language and controls into user stories</p><p>   ◇ Integrate plausibility checks at each tier of your application (from frontend to backend)</p><p>   ◇ Write unit and integration tests to validate that all critical flows are resistant to the threat model. Compile use-cases and misuse-cases for each tier of your application.</p><p>   ◇ Segregate tier layers on the system and network layers depending on the exposure and protection needs</p><p>   ◇ Segregate tenants robustly by design throughout all tiers</p><p>   ◇ Limit resource consumption by user or service</p></div>
