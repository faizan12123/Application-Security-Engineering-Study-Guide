<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Factors to Consider</h1><br/><p>When performing manual secure source code reviews, it is important to consider the following factors:</p><p><ol><li>Application architecture: Understanding the application&#39;s architecture and design is crucial in identifying potential security vulnerabilities.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Business requirements: Understanding the business requirements of the application will help determine which security risks are most critical and need to be addressed first.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Attack surface: Analyzing the attack surface of the application will help identify potential entry points for attackers and prioritize areas that require additional attention.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>User input validation: Checking how user input is validated in the application and ensuring that it is properly sanitized to prevent attacks is a critical factor in securing an application.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Access controls: Reviewing access controls to ensure that users can only access data they are authorized to view helps prevent unauthorized access.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Error handling: Ensuring that error messages do not reveal sensitive information and that they are handled securely helps prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Encryption: Verifying that sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest helps protect against data breaches.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Third-party libraries: Reviewing third-party libraries used in the application for known vulnerabilities or weaknesses can help prevent attacks on these components.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Compliance requirements: Ensuring compliance with industry-specific regulations such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, or GDPR may dictate specific security requirements that need to be addressed during a code review.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Development process: Assessing how security is integrated into the development process can help identify areas where improvements can be made to ensure more secure coding practices are followed.</li></ol></p></div>
