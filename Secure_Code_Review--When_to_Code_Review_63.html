<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>When to Code Review</h1><br/><p>Manual code reviews should be performed during the development process after the code has been written and before it is deployed to production. It is important to review the code manually because it helps to identify potential issues, bugs, or security vulnerabilities that may have been missed during automated testing. Manual code reviews also help to ensure that the code meets coding standards and best practices, and that it is easy to maintain and modify in the future. It is recommended to perform manual code reviews regularly throughout the development process, especially for critical parts of the application.</p></div>
