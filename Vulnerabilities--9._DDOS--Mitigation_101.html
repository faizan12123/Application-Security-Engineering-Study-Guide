<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Mitigation</h1><br/><p><ol><li>Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN): A CDN can help absorb large amounts of traffic during an attack by distributing the load across multiple servers. This can help prevent the targeted server from becoming overwhelmed and going offline.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Implement rate limiting: Rate limiting is a technique used to limit the number of requests that can be made to a server within a certain time period. This can help prevent attackers from flooding the server with too many requests at once.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Use traffic filtering: Traffic filtering is a technique used to identify and block malicious traffic before it reaches the server. This can include blocking traffic from known botnets or IP addresses associated with previous attacks.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Deploy DDoS protection services: There are many third-party DDoS protection services available that can help detect and mitigate attacks in real-time. These services use advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify and block malicious traffic.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Regularly test your system for vulnerabilities: Regular security audits and vulnerability scans can help identify potential weaknesses in the system that could be exploited by attackers.</li></ol></p></div>
