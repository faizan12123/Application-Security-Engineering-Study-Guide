<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>7. Buffer Overflow</h1><br/><p>A Buffer Overflow vulnerability is a type of vulnerability that occurs when an application writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overflow into adjacent memory locations. </p><p></p><p>This can happen due to various reasons such as improper input validation, lack of bounds checking, or other issues in programming languages such as C and C++. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted input to the application, which can cause it to execute arbitrary code or crash.</p><p></p><p>In web applications, Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities can occur in server-side components such as CGI scripts or custom modules written in C/C++. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or take control of the server.</p></div>
