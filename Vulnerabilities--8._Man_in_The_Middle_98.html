<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>8. Man in The Middle</h1><br/><p>A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is a type of attack where an attacker intercepts communication between two parties to eavesdrop, steal data, or impersonate one of the parties. </p><p></p><p>In web application security, MitM attacks can occur when a user&#39;s traffic is intercepted by an attacker who has gained access to the network. This can happen on public Wi-Fi networks or other unsecured networks where traffic is not encrypted.</p><p></p><p>In a MitM attack, the attacker intercepts communication between two parties to eavesdrop, steal data, or impersonate one of the parties. The attacker does this by inserting themselves into the communication channel between the two parties.</p><p></p><p>For example, if Alice wants to communicate with Bob over an unsecured network, an attacker could intercept their traffic by placing themselves between Alice and Bob. The attacker could then eavesdrop on their conversation or modify the data being transmitted.</p></div>
