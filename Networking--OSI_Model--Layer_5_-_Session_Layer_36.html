In the case of a disconnect or a crash after 52 megabytes have been transferred, the session could be resumed from the last checkpoint, meaning only 50 more megabytes of data need to be transferred. Without the checkpoints, the entire transfer would have to begin again from scratch.</p><p>• Usually, the main tasks include authentication and authorization, downloads files as data packets, session management.</p></div>
