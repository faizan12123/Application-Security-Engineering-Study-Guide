<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Integrating Into SSDLC</h1><br/><p>Incorporating secure code review into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is an important step in ensuring that applications are developed with security in mind. Here are some steps you can take to incorporate secure code review into the Secure SDLC (SSDLC):</p><p><ol><li>Define coding standards: Define coding standards and guidelines for developers to follow, including best practices for secure coding. This should include guidelines for input validation, authentication and authorization, error handling, encryption, and other security-related topics.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Conduct threat modeling: Conduct threat modeling to identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities early in the development process. This will help you prioritize which areas of the code need to be reviewed more thoroughly.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Use automated tools: Use automated tools such as static analysis tools or vulnerability scanners to identify potential security issues in the code.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Conduct manual code reviews: Conduct manual code reviews by trained security professionals who can identify more complex security issues that may not be caught by automated tools.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Perform penetration testing: Perform penetration testing on the application to identify any vulnerabilities that may have been missed during earlier stages of development.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Implement a bug tracking system: Implement a bug tracking system to track identified vulnerabilities and ensure that they are addressed before release.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Provide feedback to developers: Provide feedback to developers on identified vulnerabilities and how they can be addressed in future development cycles.</p><p></li></ol></p></div>
