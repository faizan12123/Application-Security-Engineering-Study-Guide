<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Kill Chain</h1><br/><p>• Kill Chain</p><p>   ◇ A model developed by Lockheed Martin that describes the stages by which a threat actor progresses a network intrusion</p><p>      ▪ Reconnaissance</p><p>         - The attacker determines what methods to use to complete the phases of the attack</p><p>      ▪ Weaponization</p><p>         - The attacker couples payload code that will enable access with exploit code that will use a vulnerability to execute on the target system</p><p>      ▪ Delivery</p><p>         - The attacker identifies a vector by which to transmit the weaponized code to the target environment</p><p>      ▪ Exploitation</p><p>         - The weaponized code is executed on the target system by this mechanism</p><p>      ▪ Installation</p><p>         - This mechanism enables the weaponized code to run a remote access tool and achieve persistence on the target system</p><p>      ▪ Command &amp; Control (C2)</p><p>         - The weaponized code establishes an outbound channel to a remote server that can then be used to control the remote access tool and possibly download additional tools to progress the attack</p><p>      ▪ Actions on Objectives</p><p>         - The attacker typically uses the access he has achieved to covertly collect information from target systems and transfer it to a remote system (data exfiltration) or achieve other goals and motives</p><p>         - Kill chain analysis can be used to identify a defensive course-of-action matrix to counter the progress of an attack at each stage</p></div>
