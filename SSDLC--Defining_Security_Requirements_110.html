<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Defining Security Requirements</h1><br/><p><ol><li>Identify the assets: Start by identifying the assets that need to be protected. This includes any data, systems, or infrastructure that is critical to your organization&#39;s operations. Examples of assets include customer data, financial information, intellectual property, and physical facilities.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Assess the risks: Conduct a risk assessment to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities that could impact the security of your assets. This involves identifying potential threats (such as hackers or natural disasters) and vulnerabilities (such as outdated software or weak passwords) that could be exploited by these threats. Once you have identified these risks, you can prioritize them based on their likelihood and potential impact.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Define security objectives: Based on the results of your risk assessment, define specific security objectives that need to be met in order to protect your assets. These objectives should be measurable and aligned with business goals. For example, an objective might be to reduce the risk of a data breach by 50% within the next year.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Determine compliance requirements: Identify any regulatory or industry-specific compliance requirements that must be met. This may include regulations such as HIPAA or PCI DSS, which require specific security controls to protect sensitive data.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Establish security controls: Determine what security controls are needed to meet your security objectives and comply with relevant regulations. This may include access controls (such as two-factor authentication), encryption (to protect sensitive data), intrusion detection/prevention systems (to detect and prevent attacks), and more.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Develop policies and procedures: Develop policies and procedures that outline how these security controls will be implemented and enforced within your organization. This includes defining roles and responsibilities for employees, establishing incident response procedures in case of a breach, and outlining guidelines for acceptable use of company resources.</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Test and validate: Once you have defined your security requirements, test and validate them through penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, or other forms of testing to ensure they are effective at mitigating risks. Regular testing is important to ensure that your security measures remain effective over time as new threats emerge.</li></ol></p><p></p><p>By following these steps in preparing to define security requirements, you can help ensure that your organization is well-protected against cyber threats while also complying with relevant regulations and industry standards</p></div>
