Examples of elevated access include:</p><p>      ▪ SYSTEM/root level</p><p>      ▪ local administrator</p><p>      ▪ user account with admin-like access</p><p>      ▪ user accounts with access to specific system or perform specific function</p><p>   ◇ These techniques often overlap with Persistence techniques, as OS features that let an adversary persist can execute in an elevated context.</p><p></p><p>• Defense Evasion</p><p>   ◇ </p><p>	</p></div>
