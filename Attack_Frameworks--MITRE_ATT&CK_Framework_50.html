Examples of elevated access include:<ul><li>SYSTEM/root level</li><li>local administrator</li><li>user account with admin-like access</li><li>user accounts with access to specific system or perform specific function</li></ul></li><li>These techniques often overlap with Persistence techniques, as OS features that let an adversary persist can execute in an elevated context.</li></ul></li></ul></p><p><ul><li>Defense Evasion<ul><li></li></ul></li></ul></p><p>	</p></div>
